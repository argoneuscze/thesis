# Exploring usage of non-negative matrix factorization in audio compression

This repository stores the research and report part of my Master's thesis.

The implementation part is visible [**here**](https://github.com/argoneuscze/AudioNMF).

## Assignment (WIP)

The aim of this work is to research existing methods for lossy audio compression and try to apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in order
to improve the compression ratio without a noticeable loss in quality. Therefore, the goals are as following:

1. Become familiar with state-of-the-art audio encoding and compression methods
2. Become familiar with non-negative matrix factorization, its properties and applications
3. Implement a proof of concept audio codec utilizing NMF for audio compression, or extend an existing codec with this functionality
4. Compare the results with an existing solution, try to measure quality difference
