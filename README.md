# Exploring use of non-negative matrix factorization for lossy audio compression

This repository stores the research and report part of my Master's thesis.

The implementation part is visible [**here**](https://github.com/argoneuscze/AudioNMF).

## Assignment

The aim of this work is to research existing methods for lossy audio compression and to apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in order
to improve the compression ratio without a noticeable loss in quality. Therefore, the goals are as following:

1. Become familiar with state of the art digital audio encoding and compression methods
2. Become familiar with non-negative matrix factorization, its properties and applications in digital audio processing
3. Design and implement a proof of concept audio codec utilizing NMF for audio compression, or extend an existing codec with this functionality
4. Find a suitable method for measuring perceived audio quality
5. Measure the resulting audio quality and compare the quality and compression ratio to existing solutions
